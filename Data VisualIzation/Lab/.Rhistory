# (vii) Conclusion
#In social network research, the SNA and igraph packages in R were utilized to analyze a dataset with network data involving different nodes. By computing the hub and authority scores of each node, a network diagram was created. The identification of communities in the network revealed that nodes within the same group were highly connected, while nodes between different groups were only weakly connected.
